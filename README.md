# üß¨ Siro
Siro is a simple medical assistant system deployed on Streamlit. It consists of five main functional modules:

‚Ä¢	üìã Medical record collection 

‚Ä¢	üß¥ Skin disease diagnosis based on picture prediction

‚Ä¢	ü§í Symptom diagnosis based on text input (Also includes disease prediction, severity Assessment, Medical Advice, and doctor and medicine recommendation.)

‚Ä¢	üíä Medicine Search by text

‚Ä¢	üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Diagnosis based on health records and system's predicted results.

Siro is a developer‚Äôs attempt to apply AI in the field of medical consultation. The developer aims to build an AI-supported medical consultation system to save medical resources and improve the efficiency of the healthcare process.

### üåé Project download
Since the project includes some large datasets and models, you can click [here]( https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/h_shi1220231_arts_ac_uk/EbucxCL38lZAv89_uEF4nqMBEgVGQAdXjatTz0fevaz3Sw?e=yKOfkh) to download them if needed and experience the full functionality.

# üêç How to use
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Guided Video
You can learn how to use Siro through a [guided video]( https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/h_shi1220231_arts_ac_uk/EZRiLR7vTodHjLo_POplW84BcP0sMflfkgqoXM__XElizw?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=FAD2Q7), but please note that the video contains some incorrect statements regarding the model‚Äôs accuracy and loss‚Äîplease disregard those parts.

### üß≠ Usage Process 
First, please enter the following command in the terminal:
```bash
streamlit run medical_app.py
```
- It will open the Streamlit webpage in your default browser.

- You can interact with various features on the webpage and switch between pages using the switch page button.

- Suggested usage flow: please try the medical record feature first, and finish by trying the doctor diagnosis feature.

# üìå Example

### üìã Medical record collection 
Record the basic information of the patient, including biological sex, age, medical history, and so on.

### üß¥ Skin disease diagnosis
Perform diagnosis of skin diseases based on images uploaded by the user or captured via the camera.

### ü§í Symptom diagnosis

Users can input their symptoms via voice or text. The system will provide a series of medical diagnoses and recommendations, including Symptom Prediction, Disease Prediction, Doctor Recommendation, Disease Advice, Disease Severity assessment, and Medicine Use guidance.

# üöÄ Updates
**2025.05**
The project underwent considerable adjustments in both code implementation and structure in order to better align with industry standards.

- ¬©Ô∏è ‚Äúclean code‚Äù: The file and variable names have been standardized and modified to avoid irregular naming conventions and inconsistent use of letter cases.

- ¬©Ô∏è [Functional modularization](https://github.com/BreakzngGood/A-Simple-medical-assistant-system/tree/2bbbeb6af9fbbb9ce71a26c1be9123460728199e/medical_assistant_package): Repetitive code, especially in Streamlit form construction, was refactored into modular functions to enhance clarity and reusability.At the same time, the developer categorized the numerous functions in the code and encapsulated them within a single package.

- ¬©Ô∏è Code structure iteration: Mainly applied adjustments to the program‚Äôs main entry control structure to facilitate subsequent development and maintenance.

- ¬©Ô∏è Exception handling: The code includes exception capturing and appropriate error messages across multiple functions, especially in importing and saving JSON files, to prevent program crashes.

- ¬©Ô∏è [Unit test](https://github.com/BreakzngGood/A-Simple-medical-assistant-system/tree/2bbbeb6af9fbbb9ce71a26c1be9123460728199e/tests)ÔºöThe main medical functionalities were tested using pytest/unittest.

- ¬©Ô∏è [Configuration File Setup](https://github.com/BreakzngGood/A-Simple-medical-assistant-system/blob/2bbbeb6af9fbbb9ce71a26c1be9123460728199e/medical_assistant_package/config.py): A configuration file is used to centrally manage project-level variables such as datasets and models.
