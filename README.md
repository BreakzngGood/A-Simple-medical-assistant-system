# ðŸ§¬ Siro
Siro is a simple medical assistant system deployed on Streamlit. It consists of five main functional modules:

â€¢	Medical record collection 
â€¢	Skin disease diagnosis based on picture prediction
â€¢	Symptom diagnosis based on text input (Also includes disease prediction, severity Assessment, Medical Advice, and doctor and medicine recommendation.)
â€¢	Medicine Search by text
â€¢	Doctor Diagnosis based on health records and system's predicted results.
